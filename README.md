About
=====

`filterdesigner` is a program inspired by the [Tone Stack Calculator](http://www.duncanamps.com/tsc/), except that you can design your own arbitrary schematic instead of using pre-defined "tone stacks". You define your schematic, including basic passive components, op-amps, and potentiometers; then you can simulate the circuit's frequency response, adjusting the potentiometer positions to see the impact in real time.

The intended use is to help design tone circuits for guitar amplifiers or other audio gear, but maybe it can have other uses.

You should consider this software to be alpha quality. The basic functionality works (rather well), but the UI lacks much polish, and bugs should be expected, especially if your circuits is "wrong" in some way: the program does absolutely no sanity check on it before attempting to simulate. Save your work before simulating :-)
